# migration-automator-v2

An upgrade of the MigrationAutomationRunner, using docker and Angular2 CLI. UI side plan to use Bootstrap + Angular Material(still in beta). The functionalities are largely the same, but plan to add more logging and a few functionalities (to be determined). The ultimate goal is to push the code into my company's private rancher stack.
